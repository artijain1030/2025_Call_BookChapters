      <h2>About the Handbook</h2>
      <p>This book presents a comprehensive exploration of next-generation AI architectures for climate resilience, focusing on robust hazard prediction and efficient mitigation through advanced data-driven approaches. It details the use of large-scale, heterogeneous environmental datasets—including satellite imagery, GIS, hydrological and meteorological time-	series, and real-time sensor data—alongside state-of-the-art preprocessing, feature engineering, and data fusion techniques.</p>
      <p>The technical core covers cutting-edge machine learning frameworks such as deep convolutional neural networks for spatial analysis, recurrent networks and transformers for temporal modeling, and ensemble learning for improved prediction reliability. Special emphasis is placed on spatiotemporal modeling, attention mechanisms for interpretability, and hybrid 	architectures that integrate physical process models with data-driven AI. The integration of AI with cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine enables scalable, near real-time 	hazard monitoring and automated early warning systems.</p>
      <p>The book highlights explainable AI (XAI) methods—such as SHAP and Grad-CAM—for transparent decision support in disaster management. Case studies showcase AI applications in wildfire detection, flood forecasting, drought monitoring, and landslide risk assessment, with validation against simulation models and ground truth. It further examines AI-enabled 	sensor networks, edge computing, and emerging technologies like generative AI for synthetic data, digital twins for environment simulation, and quantum computing for accelerating 	climate models, serving as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners advancing AI-based climate hazard solutions.</p>
      <p>This upcoming book is being submitted to Elsevier for publication and Scopus indexing, ensuring high academic visibility and global reach.</p>
